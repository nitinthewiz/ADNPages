# Welcome to ADNPages 2.0

* * *	

So, I guess this is Markdown. I must confess, I'm not a fan, despite it being the best way to write visual elements into plaintext. 

So, I need some help. I need a programmer who can work with me on this silly little idea of mine. What this idea needs - 

* A much better UI
* Some better interaction with ADN
	- A way to cross post, maybe RSS
	- A way to make pages right here that get saved into your ADN Files. That way, your files are right where you want them to be, no matter what happens to the frontend.

What do we get with this? _A Blogging Engine!_

**Hey, Maybe MD isn't as bad as I thought it'd be**
