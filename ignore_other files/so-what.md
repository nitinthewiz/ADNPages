# So, what's the fuss about?

* * *	

Oh come on, everyone likes Blogging engines.

_Q. But Why Make one in PHP with Markdown and ADN support?_

Ans. Because we can.

_Q. But it doesn't have anything else_

Ans. Yes, I need your help. Please contact me. I'm [@nitinkhanna](https://alpha.app.net/nitinkhanna) on ADN

_Q. All right, where'd you steal it from?_

Ans. Most of it is from Jacob Bednarz on [GitHub](https://github.com/jacobbednarz/markdown_blog). But the idea to integrate it with ADN Files is mine. Boo Yah!

_Q. Can I look at the actual MD file?_

Ans. Sure, here's [one](https://files.app.net/mdvdLoJD)…

_Q. Ew! This Markdown is ugly!_

Ans. Really? I wouldn't know. I just stole that guy's code. I was gonna steal his [blog](http://jacobbednarz.com/blog/) too, but it'd be rude to do so. Like I said, I don't 'get' markdown, so I need your help. This code is not going open source yet, but it soon will, so please help if you can…
